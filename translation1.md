B. Grammatical questions
Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Dexamenum, then identify the form Dexamenum. Dexamenus, Dexameni m. Dexamenum is accusative singular.

Write a dictionary entry (nominative singular, genitive singular, gender) for Deianiram, then identify the form Deianiram. Deianira, Deianirae f. Deianiram is accusative singular.

Identify the form abesset, and explain why it is this tense and mood. It is third person singular singular imperfect active subjunctive. It is imperfect because Hercules being away was happening at the same time as the centaur attacking Deianira, not before. The reason it is subjunctive is because this emphasizes that the centaur attacked her *because* Hercules was away; that the circumstance is important and not merely given to place the event in time.

Identify the form uenisset, and explain why it is this tense and mood. It is third person singular pluperfect active subjunctive. This is because him coming to the king is a circumstance (subjunctive) that happened before, as background to, him wanting Deianira as a wife.

Identify the form pollicitus est. What dictionary form would you look under to find this verb? It is third person singular perfect indicative, and since it is a deponent verb it is passive, as always. It is in the dictionary under the first person singular present passive indicative, which is "polliceor."

Identify the form of the noun-adjective phrase tempore certo, and explain why it is in this case. These words are in their ablative singular neuter forms. The neuter is just because tempus is a neuter noun, and singular is because the event is happening at one specific time. It is in the ablative case because it is saying exactly when something happened and not giving an extent of time.

C. Translation
Please translate the passgae into idiomatic English.
Hercules had come to King Dexamenus in hospitality and taken the virginity of his daughter Deianira, wanting to take her as a wife. When Hercules was away, the centaur Eurytion attacked Deianira the wife. Since her father feared the centaur, he promised he would give him her. At a certain time, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules went among them and killed the centaur, and he took Deianira away.
