**Questions**

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase? Iove is ablative because this is the ablative absolute.

What case is stercus, and why is it in that case? It is the accusative case, because it is the direct object of abluit.

Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree). It is feminine accusative singular comparative.

Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso. It is ablative absolute. This is used because it is meant to convey that the river was sent in and that this fact is linked to the purifying of the stables, but it allows the sentence to mean both that the manure was washed away *because* of the river going in, and that it happened *once* the river was sent in.

What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui? It is masculine plural nominative, and it refers to the king's horses.

What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus? Erant.

Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passageâ€™s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

In the first part, the sentence before the semicolon is written in a complex way, being broken into three parts and having a lot of modifying words in the first part. However, after the semicolon, the sentence is very simple. Each of its constituent parts are very short and convey simple ideas. I think this helps the audience understand the ease with which the stables were cleaned by the river.

In the third part, the lack of a verb in the sentence after the semicolon contributes to the aside manner of the observation. The names of the horses aren't very important to the story, but the writer wants to include them anyway. By noting the names in a verbless sentence, the brief nature of the sentence makes it clear that this is just a minor note.
