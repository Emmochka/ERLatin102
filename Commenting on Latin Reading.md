As you did in translation 2:
please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading,
and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.

Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.

aues Stymphalides in insula Martis, quae emissis pennis suis iaculabantur, sagittis interfecit.

> I like that Hyginus puts the comment about the birds' method of attack right before the description of how Hercules killed them. This sets up a nice contrast -- even a visual one, looking at the letters used in the words -- between *pennis iaculabantur* and *sagittis interfecit*. By having these two similar actions right next to each other, it gives the impression that Hercules is beating the birds at their own game when he kills them with his arrows.

quam Hercules iam induerat, statim-que flagrare coepit; qui cum se in flumen coniecisset ut ardorem extingueret, maior flamma exibat.

> This idea is broken down into 2 sort parts (actually 3, but I wanted to focus on these two). Since they are both short but linked, this makes the ideas seem to come at the reader quickly, one after another. This conveys the disastrously rapid progression of events when Hecules puts on the shirt and things quickly go bad. This is doubly good writing since the second sentence describes how Hercules was trying to *halt* the fire, so the quick addition of it becoming worse drives home how dire the situation is.
