In the following sentences, first identify independent and dependent verbal constructions: clauses, indirect statements and participles.
Place each on a separate line, and indent to show the level of subordination, as you did in translation 1.

Each sentence includes a participle (present active or perfect passive). Identify what noun or pronoun it agrees with.
Suggest an interpretation to guide your translation of the participial expression as a dependent clause in English.
You should be able to explain what clues you looked at to decide on a possible translation.
