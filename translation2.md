**Questions**

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination.
Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

> Flumen, neuter singular. It is dative, and it translates as "to whom the name was Evenus." This is how names are given in Latin.

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

> It is the present indicative, and I put it with poterat because it completes the idea of poterat.

3. Sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

> Feminine accusative singular perfect passive. urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n48489

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?

> Ablative plural, and it is ablative because it is the ablative of instrument.

5. Identify the form of moriens.

> Participle, masculine nominative sngular present active.

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?

> Ablative, and it is because the arrows had been dipped *in* bile.  ✔️ (So *means* or *instrument*.)


7. Identify the form of tinctas.

> Participle, feminine plural nominative perfect passive.

8. Identify the form of exceptum.

> Participle, neuter singular nominative perfect passive. 

9. William Faulkner’s novel *As I lay dying* takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

> Mortuus, moriens.🤔 **The second option I definitely understand; but the perfect tense of the first option seems to me hard to reconcile with the idea that "I was in the process of dying..."
